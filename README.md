# Manuel - Mobile Advanced Native UI Enhanced Library

## 1. Overview

Manuel is a mobile library which lets Mobile Developers to build rich UI for their applications. Manuel has a set of UI components common used in mobile apps, each component is easy to extend and configure.

## 2. A little history

The idea behind the library came to my mind while developing several applications I´ve started to reuse some components and I´ve decided to put those components in a library and share with the world.

The name of library is just the name of one of my colleague I asked for help to write the UI components for iOS, once I´ve decided use Manuel as the name of the library, few days after came to my mind the long name "Mobile Advanced Native UI Enhanced Library" that probably with the time has nothing related with the reality of the library.

## 3. Contribute

We are more than happy to accept contributions to the library and build together a bigger set of components, you just need to fork the repository, code and send a pull request.
